# Busy-ly

Imagine a study group where you can connect with your friends remotely, meet new people, and actually be productive. This is Busy-ly: the synchronous online Pomodoro timer where you can Tune in, Turn On, Nerd Out. While the Pomodoro timer ticks down you can focus on your studies, but in between study sessions the app matches you with another user from anywhere in the world, choosing people with similar interests so that you can both study and help each other. You can then add these people to your friends list, where you can synchronize your clocks and be busy together.
